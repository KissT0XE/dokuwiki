assurance from paragraphs A through C below (end-use, 
retransfer and security assurances). 
 
In accordance with the foregoing, the Government of the 
Republic of Korea hereby gives its assurances: 
 
 
(A)   That the Government of the Republic of Korea will not, 
unless the prior written consent of the Government of the 
United States of America has been first obtained: 
 
       (I)   Permit any use of said 53 F-4E spare parts 
information or any component thereof (including technical

       (II)  Transfer or permit any officer, employee, or

(C)  The Government of the Republic of Korea will use said 53 
F-4E spare parts information or any component thereof
