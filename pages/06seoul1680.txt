====== 코피 아난 유엔 사무총장 방문에 대한 한국 전언 ======

¶1.  (SBU) On May 17, Oh Young-ju, MOFAT's Deputy Director for 
the UN Division, provided poloff with a brief readout of UN 
Secretary General Kofi Annan's visit to Seoul.  During his 
** 5월 17일 외교통상부 UN담당 과장은  코피 아난 유엔 사무총장 방문에 대한 브리핑을 했다.  **

SIPDIS 
May 14-16 visit to the ROK, Annan met with President Roh, 
Foreign Minister Ban, and visited Seoul National University. 
 **5/14~5/16까지 방문하는 동안 코피 아난 총장은 노무현 대통령과 외무부 장관 반기문을 만나고 서울대를 방문했다.**

¶2.  (SBU) Deputy Director Oh said that in his meeting with 
Foreign Minister Ban, UNSYG Annan raised several topics, 
including UN reform, developmental assistance, Iran, 
inter-Korean relations, North Korea, and ROK-Japanese 
relations.  Ban stressed Seoul's support for UN reform, 
including the establishment of the Human Rights Council and 
the Peacebuilding Commission, calling them positive steps 
toward making the UN more competent and more efficient.  Ban 
also welcomed Annan's reform proposal called "Investing in 
the UN."  Seoul planned to resolve its arrears to the UN by 
2008, as well as double its overseas development aid to 
Africa by 2009.  Annan replied that international health and 
humanitarian, as well as natural disaster relief efforts, 
required increased financial support from UN member 
countries, remarking that the increased ROK ODA was a "good 
step" for an emerging donor nation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ban and Annan reiterated the need for a negotiated 
solution to the Iran and North Korean nuclear issues, with 
Annan specifically saying that the USG could play an 
important role in achieving peaceful resolutions.  Annan also 
expressed an interest in inter-Korean developments, such as 
the announcement that the Koreas had agreed to trial runs on 
inter-Korean railways later in May.  Despite the lack of 
progress in the Six Party Talks, the forum would be useful 
for reaching a diplomatic resolution to the North Korean 
nuclear issue.  Asked about Annan's statement that the 
nuclear issue should take precedence over other issues with 
North Korea, Oh said Annan was simply responding to a 
reporter's question and that this was separate from the 
Ban-Annan meeting. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Oh said that Annan raised the subject of 
Korean-Japanese relations in his meetings with Ban and 
President Roh.  Ban and Roh provided detailed explanations of 
the historical aspects of the territorial dispute related to 
the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima).  Annan expressed hope 
for improved bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo that 
could strengthen prospects for a peaceful and professional 
understanding.  Oh also confirmed press reports that Roh 
actually drew a map of the Korean Peninsula and the disputed 
islets during the discussion to, as she noted, explain to an 
important international visitor the South Korean position on 
the issue.  She opined that the President does not need much 
of an opening to show his interest in the topic.
